    In the breadcrumb part I only made 'Home Page' and 'Category clickable'<br/>
    User can display all product for that specific category in category.html page.

 # Issues encountered:
    1- I struggled with sending the data while creating the search result section.<br/>
         At first, all the data was visible, but as I grasped the logic of Flask a bit more, I figured out the issue.<br/>
    2- "I faced difficulties deploying the application to pyhtonanywhere.com because I was attempting to use PostgreSQL in my project, but I needed to upgrade my membership for PostgreSQL. Instead, I switched to MySQL, and the problem was resolved."<br/>
